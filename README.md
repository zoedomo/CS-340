# How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?
In my work on the CRUD Python module for Project One, I highlighted the importance of maintainability, readability, and adaptability. I achieved this by adopting a modular approach, where each function in the module was dedicated to a specific CRUD operation - Create, Read, Update, or Delete. This not only made the code more organized but also easier to understand and modify. I also paid close attention to documentation and code readability. This was vital in guaranteeing that anyone who worked on the project after me could easily understand and build upon my work. The reusability of the CRUD module was a significant advantage. When we moved to Project Two, connecting the dashboard widgets to the database was seamless because the CRUD operations were already well-defined and abstracted. This approach not only saved time but also maintained consistency across different components of the project. Looking ahead, I see numerous applications for this CRUD module, like e-commerce platforms.

# How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
My approach to solving problems, particularly in the context of the database and dashboard requirements for Grazioso Salvare, was methodical and client focused. Unlike previous assignments where the importance might have been more on hypothetical aspects, here I concentrated on thoroughly understanding the client’s needs first. In the future, I plan to employ strategies that emphasize client-centric design, scalability, and data security. 

# What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
A computer scientist’s role extends beyond just writing code. It involves solving complex problems, driving innovation, and analyzing data to originate insights. By developing efficient and scalable systems, I helped streamline operations, facilitate data-driven decision-making, and ensure the business can adapt to changing technological landscapes. This not only improves operational efficiency but also improves customer service and keeps the business competitive.
